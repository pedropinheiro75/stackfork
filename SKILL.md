description: Use when preparing, starting, testing, or cleaning up a local development environment in a Git worktree or branch with the stackfork CLI, especially when Docker Compose ports, databases, volumes, or app configuration could collide with another checkout.

# stackfork

Use the project's actual runtime, package manager and startup flow through `stackfork`, a framework-independent Compose isolation helper (optional Nuxt/Bun template included). Adapt existing stacks first; do not force a non-Nuxt or dependency-only project into the Nuxt template.

## Reuse before rediscovering

Run `stackfork where` (lists prepared instances and configured profiles) and `stackfork status` first. If `.stackfork/knowledge.md` is `verified`, apply its recorded adapter and recipe directly — no scan, no questions (`references/learning.md`). Otherwise run `stackfork learn`, read `.stackfork/knowledge.md`, and run the learn session in `references/learning.md`. Do not repeat a full discovery, or rewrite a launcher, for a routine restart of an unchanged adapter. Before preparing a brand-new instance, run `stackfork list` — an instance for this project may already exist elsewhere (another branch, another worktree) with data worth starting from via `clone-db --from <instance>` instead of an empty database, or `clone-db --from-dump FILE` to seed from a local `.sql`/`.sql.gz`/Postgres dump (or `stackfork dashboard` for the same cross-checkout view in a local, read-mostly web page — never used for the destructive commands below).

## Follow profile context

For each profile `stackfork where` lists with `"context": true`, follow that profile's `context.md` first, before anything below — it may point at a private reference and template for this project instead of the generic one. Profiles are private and never part of this repository.

## Prepare, start, verify, stop

1. **Discover:** resolve the checkout with Git, read AGENTS.md/README, and adapt the project's real Compose stack (`references/adapting-compose.md`, or a template for a bare app with no app-building Compose at all: `references/nuxt-template.md` for Nuxt, `references/go-template.md` for a Go web app). Use a separate worktree per concurrent agent (`references/worktrees.md`).
2. **Prepare:** `stackfork --root "$CHECKOUT" prepare -f <compose files> --env-file <runtime env>`
3. **Start:** `stackfork --root "$CHECKOUT" up`. A host-run/hybrid app instead uses `eval "$(stackfork --root "$CHECKOUT" env)"` for its env vars (`references/adapting-compose.md`). Never start the app directly on the host (`bun run dev`, `npm run dev`, etc.) for a stackfork-managed checkout — that bypasses isolation.
4. **URLs:** `stackfork --root "$CHECKOUT" urls` — report the named `<instance>.localhost` URL it prints, never a bare `localhost`/`127.0.0.1` (`references/hostnames.md`).
5. **Verify:** database identity and app readiness at minimum; login, HMR and a representative flow on first adoption. Stay inside the checked-out instance for this. If verifying something would need new infrastructure beyond it (a different environment mode, a second stack, anything you'd have to build rather than just check) — ask first; report the gap instead of silently building it.
6. **Stop:** `stackfork --root "$CHECKOUT" down` (keeps data).

## One-off builds and tests

A one-off build or test that could fight the running dev process (a different install step, a migration, a full test run) uses `stackfork --root "$CHECKOUT" run <service> <cmd>` (a fresh, separate container), never `exec` into the running one. When it's done, `stackfork --root "$CHECKOUT" down` (data kept) unless the user asked to keep the instance running.

## Refusals and deletion

Trust `stackfork prepare`'s refusals (fixed container names, external networks, Docker sockets, writable binds outside the checkout, fixed subnets) — never work around one. `down --volumes` and `gc --apply --volumes` delete data and need the user's own authorization for that specific deletion; never infer either from a request to restart or clean up in general — `gc` (orphaned instances whose checkout or branch is gone) only runs on explicit user request, never on your own initiative. Never open or copy another project's real env files, registry credentials, certificates or private keys.

## Report

Report checkout, branch, Compose project, app/DB/auxiliary endpoints, and the checks actually run, without any credential values. Distinguish a validated Compose model and running dependencies from a working application — do not describe a dependency-only check as full application validation.

Full command reference: `references/commands.md`; or run `stackfork help` / `stackfork <command> --help`.
